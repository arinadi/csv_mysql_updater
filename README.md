# [Punch v2.0.0] MySQLi Support (PHP 5.6+)

Punch is a open source tool that helps you in updating data from CSV to MySQL based on specific Search Key.



## Quick start

Simple four Step Process:

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/raghunathj/Punch/).
* Change the database settings and csv file path in config.php.
* Run index.php and select the Database table column you want to search for, and select CSV column to search from.
* Select CSV column data you want to update and select its appropriate db columns which need to be affected. You can update multiple columns in a table by selecting "add column".

## Output

Once the updation is done, you can see the report of what all data was updated and what all failed.

## Failure

Failed Update might be for the following reason:

* The search key/value is not matching with the selected column value.
* The data in CSV is same as in the Database.



## Versioning

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Punch will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
